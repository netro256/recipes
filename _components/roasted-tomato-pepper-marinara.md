ingredients:
- 5 large tomatoes, cored
- 1 red bell pepper, roasted, peeled
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Salt, to taste
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced ¼ cup red wine
- 1 Tbsp fresh chopped oregano
- Freshly ground pepper, to taste

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400°
- Rub tomatoes with olive oil, season with salt, and roast in a hot oven until the skins are browned and blistered.
- Preheat broiler to high. Cut the very top and bottom of the bell pepper. Cut in half vertically and remove the stem, seeds, and ribs. Place the two halves on a metal sheet pan and brush lightly with olive oil. Place under the broiler and cook until most of the skin is blackened. Remove and let cool. When cool enough to handle, peel the skin away from the flesh, being certain to scrape away any black bits of skin with a paring knife.
- Heat a medium sauce pot on medium heat. When hot, add olive oil to coat the pan. Saute the onion and garlic until the onion is transparent. Add the red wine and bring to a boil; reduce until wine is almost completely evaporated.
- Remove skins from tomatoes. Add tomatoes and roasted pepper to the onions. Cook until blended or puree in a food processor. Stir in the chopped oregano. Season to taste. Makes about 3 cups.
