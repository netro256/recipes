This is one of my favorite (and free) recipe books! If you find that cooking is exhausting, but you need to eat and want to have some variations in your diet, then check out this book!

Unfortunately, there are almost never physical copies available. At least, I usually can't find any. But this is a pdf cookbook, and I like to keep a copy on each of my devices for the convenience! 

I personally recommend the “Baked” Apples recipe, and I love the inclusion of the premade shopping lists and weekly menus to help you plan your week!
