Lately, I have been reading *Goodbye, Vitamin* by Rachel Khong (I recommend it, go read it). There is one part where the main character, Ruth, is handed a little paper book by a guy she just met who says “Someone told me it’s a tradition they have in Thailand... Over there the thing to do before you die is compose a cookbook. That way, all the guests at your funeral get to depart with a party favor.”

So in a way, this website is my party favor to my friends and family. I didn't feel like printing out cookbooks because I still want to add to my collection. Plus, as Ruth says to the guy, “but here you are, alive.” The guy tells her, “no sense denying that you and I will one day both be dead.” So while I am living I want to keep cooking and keep adding to this digital cookbook! And by the time I'm old and it's time to pass on, then I will have a complete cookbook, full of the memories of the food I cooked and ate! They are memories you get to live for yourself and make your own memories with. That way the memories never truly die, they just evolve with us over time.
