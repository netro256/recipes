***If you are taking the time to read this, then thank you for your curiosity!* I'm so glad I got to share this site with you! There will continue to be new recipes added all the time, so I hope you bookmark this site!**

But honestly, this site was more of a personal project. Sharing it is just a benefit! I'm so glad to finally have a "cookbook" to house all the recipes that I want to keep! This really started out of my fear of losing the amazing recipes my mom has (the ones written in pen with only one copy in a tiny box, and each one has five stains on it). These recipes are well-loved, and I want them forever. My first instinct was to type the recipes and print a new copy, but then I figured that it would be easier to share them if they were on a website! Huge shoutout to the template's creator, [clarklab](https://github.com/clarklab/chowdown), I couldn't have made such a good recipe website without a great base to build from!

I started making this site on May 9, 2023, after considering lots of templates and designs and scrapping the previous WordPress site I tried making. I've made so many changes to the original template that this site now has its own identity that feels like the perfect one that I couldn't find anywhere else. Furthermore, I've had lots of help from my family and a few friends as I kept asking for help or opinions on designs, readability, and new recipes to add. This site isn't finished, but I'm confident that it is finally in a state where I can share it without having any features break.

This site has helped me practice my web design skills and learn some good coding habits. Coding is much more my "thing" as opposed to writing and publishing a cookbook for the same effect. I won't make money off of this, but that wasn't the point to begin with! Plus, some other benefits are that I can carry this 'book' on my phone anywhere I go, and I have started trying new recipes and being more adventurous! I keep asking myself, "what's next?" and I keep asking people, "can I get your recipe for this?" I also feel like this journey has made me a better cook and more excited to cook! I don't know where this journey will take me next, but I know I'll enjoy the trip!
