cooktime: 

ingredients:
- 2 lb Russet potatoes
- 6-8 large egg yolks
- 1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano
- 1/3 tsp fresh grated nutmeg
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- All-purpose flour as needed to get right consistency

directions:
- Cook the potatoes with skin on either in the oven at 350 or by starting them in cold water and bringing them to a boil until a knife can pierce through them easily. Peel while hot and run through a ricer.
- Add yolks, parmesan, nutmeg, salt and pepper and mix together. Sprinkle flour over the surface and gently bring together as a dough. Test the gnocchi by poaching a small ball in simmering water. If it holds together nicely then continue. If not then add more flour and test again. Roll into a large log and then portion into smaller logs that you will roll to the size of your ring finger. Cut the gnocchi into Â½ inch sections and roll them over the tines of a fork or over the surface of a garganelli paddle. Place them on a parchment covered sheet pan with some flour sprinkled over the surface. Prepare a pot of well-seasoned boiling water. Add the gnocchi and cook until they float to the top.
