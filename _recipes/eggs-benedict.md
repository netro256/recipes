ingredients:
- 4 egg yolks
- 3 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon water
- 1/8 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 pinch ground white pepper
- 1 teaspoon hot water, or more as needed (Optional)
- 1 cup butter, melted
- 1 pinch salt

- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar
- 8 eggs
- 8 strips Canadian-style bacon
- 4 English muffins, split
- 2 tablespoons butter, softened



directions:
- In the top of a double boiler over simmering water, whisk egg yolks, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of water, Worcestershire sauce, and white pepper.
- Add melted butter, 1 or 2 tablespoons at a time, while whisking yolks constantly.
- If Hollandaise begins to get too thick, add a teaspoon or two of hot water. Continue whisking until all of the butter is incorporated.
- Whisk in salt, then remove top of double boiler from heat. Place a lid over the sauce to keep sauce.
- Fill a large saucepan with 2 to 3 inches of water and bring to a boil.
- Reduce heat to medium-low, pour in vinegar, and keep water at a gentle simmer.
- Crack an egg into a separate small bowl then gently slip egg into simmering water all at once, holding the bowl just above the surface of water.
- Repeat with the remaining eggs. Cook eggs until whites are firm and yolks have thickened but are not hard, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes.
- Remove eggs from water with a slotted spoon, dab on a kitchen towel to remove excess water, and place onto a warm plate.
- Meanwhile, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
- Toast English muffins on a baking sheet under the preheated broiler after making bacon.
- Brown bacon in a medium skillet over medium-high heat.
- Spread toasted muffins with softened butter and top each one with a slice of bacon, followed by one poached egg.
- Place 2 muffins on each plate and drizzle with Hollandaise sauce. Sprinkle with chopped chives and serve immediately.
