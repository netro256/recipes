tags: main

yield: 4 servings
preptime: 15 minutes
cooktime: 45 minutes

ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1/2 yellow onion, chopped (or red onion/white onion)
- 1/4 cup melted butter
- 1/4 cup flour
- 2 cups milk
- 2 cups chicken stock
- 1 1/2 cups coarsely chopped broccoli florets
- 1 cup matchstick-cut carrots
- 1 stalk celery, thinly sliced (or 1½ cups)
- 2 1/2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

directions:
- Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until tender and translucent, about 5 minutes. Set aside.
- Whisk 1/4 cup melted butter and flour together in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Continue to whisk and cook, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons of milk if necessary to keep the flour from burning, 3 to 4 minutes.
- Gradually add milk while whisking constantly; stir in chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Cook until mixture is thickened, about 20 minutes. Add broccoli, carrots, celery, and sautéed onion; simmer until all the vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.
- Stir in Cheddar cheese until melted; season with salt and pepper to taste before serving.

notes: 
- There are tons of variations and options to make this soup your own. You can add extra veggies, different cheeses, garlic to your onions, a little nutmeg to the finished soup, green onions, sour cream, etc.
