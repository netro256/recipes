tags: main

yield: 2-16 servings
preptime: 5 minutes
cooktime: 25-35 minutes

ingredients:
- chicken rub or various spices
- boneless, skinless chicken breasts/thighs
- olive oil

directions:
- Preheat oven to 400째F.
- Prepare your chicken rub or the spices you are going to use on your chicken breast to season it.
- In a baking pan, coat the bottom with olive oil.
- Place your thawed chicken breast in the baking pan. As little as one piece, as much as filling the whole pan.
- Pour a bit of olive oil on top of the chicken breast, just enough to hold onto the rub or spices.
- Pour your chicken rub or spice mixture onto the chicken breasts, covering the whole top side (don't season lightly, use plenty).
- Cover the baking pan with aluminum foil (prevents splatters from making your oven dirty).
- For 1-2 pieces of chicken, bake for 25 minutes or until internal temperature is 165째F. For a filled pan of chicken, bake for 35 minutes or until internal temperature is 165째F.
- Let chicken cool for about 5 minutes before serving or storing.

notes: 
- You can keep this chicken in your fridge for 3 days, safely. If you want to push it, you can go for 5 days. I have done that just fine.
- Invest in a meat probe thermometer to ensure your chicken is at an internal temperature is 165째F. I cannot overstate how important it is to cook chicken all the way through to prevent food poisoning. You can go above this temperature, but be careful not to burn the chicken!
- If you want a mix of spices to make your own chicken rub, look at the [Chicken Breast (Air Fryer)](chicken-breast-air-fryer) recipe for a mix!

This is my personal method for cooking chicken, which is especially convenient for me when I don't have energy to cook or grill. Baking is so much easier.
