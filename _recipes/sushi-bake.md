tags: main

yield: about 4 servings
preptime: 7 minutes
cooktime: 33 minutes

ingredients:
- 4 cups white rice, cooked (short-grain sushi rice)
- 1 lb salmon
- 1/2 cup cream cheese
- 1/2 cup Japanese mayo (+ drizzle) {not american mayo!}
- 2 tbsp sriracha (+ drizzle)
- 1/2 cup eel sauce (for drizzling & serving)
- 1/4 cup furikake
- 2 green onions, sliced
- 2 tsp rice vinegar (for seasoning)
- 1/4 tsp sugar (for seasoning)
- 1/2 tsp salt (for seasoning)
- roasted seaweed (for serving)
- cucumbers, sliced (for serving)
- avocado, sliced (for serving)
- spicy mayo (for serving)
- eel sauce (for serving)

directions:
- Pre-heat oven to 425°F.
- Season salmon lightly with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
- Bake salmon for 20 minutes.
- Pre-heat oven to 450°F, or adjust current oven to 450°F.
- In a bowl, mix together salmon, mayo, cream cheese, and sriracha.
- In a 9×13 casserole dish, layer the rice, furikake, and the salmon mixture. Then drizzle on sriracha, mayo, and eel sauce (save some of the eel sauce to serve on the side). Top with more furikake.
- Bake for 10 minutes then broil for 3 minutes until top is toasty.
- Sprinkle green onions and serve with roasted seaweed, cucumbers, avocado, spicy mayo, remaining eel sauce, and enjoy!

notes: 
- Leftovers are typically good for 3-4 days. Avoid reheating the whole dish too many times because it will dry out the rice.
- Japanese mayo is made with egg yolks and rice vinegar, whereas American mayo is made with whole eggs and white vinegar. You'll want the Japanese mayo for this recipe because it is creamier and sweeter.
