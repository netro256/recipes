yield: about 8 mochi
preparation_time: 30 minutes
cooking_time: 3.5 minutes

ingredients:
- 1 cup mochiko (sweet rice flour or glutinous rice flour) 
- 1 cup water
- ¼ cup sugar
- ~1 cup filling of your choice, roughly 1 tbsp of filling per ball
- Katakuriko (Potato starch), for rolling out the dough (or corn starch)
- 1 tsp green tea powder (optional)

directions:
- Wrap red bean paste (or other filling) in aluminum foil and place in the freezer until solid, at least 1 hour.
- Mix glutinous rice flour and green tea powder thoroughly in a microwave-safe bowl.
- Stir in warm/hot water, then sugar; mix swiftly until smooth.
- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and microwave for 3 minutes 30 seconds. If needed, heat the dough in 15 second intervals until the dough looks slightly translucent.
- Meanwhile, remove red bean paste from the freezer and divide into 8 equal balls (about 2 tablespoons each). Set aside.
- Remove rice flour mixture from the microwave. Stir and heat, covered, for another 15 to 30 seconds.
- Dust a work surface with cornstarch. Roll about 2 tablespoons of hot rice flour mixture into a ball. Flatten the ball and place one ball of frozen red bean paste in the center (like in picture below). Pinch and press the dough around the bean paste until completely covered.
- Sprinkle with additional cornstarch and place mochi, seam-side down, in a paper muffin liner to prevent sticking.
- Repeat to make remaining mochi. Store in fridge.

notes:
- Common fillings are red bean paste, white bean paste, whole dried apricots, candied chestnuts or ice cream. You can also try other fruits, cookie butter, or even nutella.
- Mochi dough is very sticky when it comes out of the microwave, but this is when it’s easiest to shape or roll. If the dough cools down too much, it will be much more difficult to manage.
- Avoid fillings that have too much moisture – otherwise liquid may seep out from the seams.
