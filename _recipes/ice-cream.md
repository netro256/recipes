yield: about 3 pints (more or less depending on flavor)
preparation_time:
cooking_time:

ingredients:
- 2 large eggs
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1 cup whole milk
- 2 cup heavy cream (AKA whipping cream)

directions:
- "1 . Whisk the eggs in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes."
- "2 . Whisk in the sugar, a little at a time, then continue whisking until completely blended, about 1 minute more."
- "3 . Pour in the cream and milk and whisk to blend. Optional: Add incorporated flavorings during this step (like vanilla or peanut butter)."
- "4 . Pour mixture into ice cream maker and churn according to manufacturer's instructions. Optional: In the last 5 minutes of churning, add other add-ins (like fruits, nuts, or candies), then keep churning for the last 5 minutes until finished."
- "5 . Transfer to containers and freeze for 3-4 hours before serving."

notes:
- There is theoretically no limit to ice cream flavor combinations. Below I've listed some helpful guidelines that help me choose the amount of add-ins for my flavors, generally the amounts are for making flavors with 1 or 2 add-ins. Mix and match and follow your heart!
- When picking a flavor, be mindful of how many things you add to the ice cream batch. Too many things could make the ice cream harder to freeze, leaving you with a sloppy cold soup. If doing 3 or more add-ins, use less than the amounts listed below.
- "Peanut Butter flavor: add 1/3 cup during step 3. Also good for Nutella or other similar things."
- "Coffee Flavor: add 3 tbsp during step 3."
- "Berry Flavors: add 1/2 cup of sliced berries (or similar) of your choice during step 4."
- "Large Soft Fruits: mash/purée 1 cup of fruit (plum, peach, pineapple, mango, etc.) and mix with 1/4 cup sugar. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Drain fruit juice into ice cream during step 3. Add fruit purée during step 4."
- "Nutty Flavors: add 2/3 cup of nuts of your choice during step 4."
- "Syrup Flavors: add 1/2 cup maple syrup (or other syrup) during step 3."
- "Other add-ins: add 1 1/2 cups of candies, cookies, cookie dough, or similar during step 4."
- "Extracts: add 2 teaspoons vanilla extract (or similar extract) during step 3. Add 3/4 tsp (1 dram) licorice flavor extract during step 3."
- "Chocolate Cherry flavor: freeze chocolate ahead of time. Add 1/4 cup shaved chocolate and 8 sliced cherries during step 4. To shave chocolate, use a chef's knife to finely shave/chop the sides of the chocolate into tiny thin shavings. For the cherries, cut into quarters."
- "Alcoholic Flavors: add up to 1/2 cup of alcohol. The more you add, the harder it is to freeze, so I recommend 1/3 cup + a splash. You can mix this with other flavors."
- "Food Coloring: I recommend starting with 10 drops of color, if desired, and add more if necessary. Adding more than 30 drops can affect consistency."

This is a nice simple recipe with a lot of potential for wild flavors, I'll add more of my notes as I experiment.
