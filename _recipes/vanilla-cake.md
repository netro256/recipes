tags: dessert, cake, baking

yield: two 9-inch cakes or 1 large cake
preparation_time: 30 minutes
cooking_time: 35 minutes

ingredients:
- 2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for the pans
- 3 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for the pans
- 1 Tbsp baking powder
- ½ tsp salt
- 1¼ cup sugar
- 4 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1 Tbsp vanilla extract
- 1¼ cup whole milk (or ¾ cup heavy cream mixed with ½ cup water)

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter two 9-inch-round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper; butter the parchment and dust the pans with flour, tapping out the excess.
- Whisk 3 cups flour, the baking powder and salt in a bowl until combined. Beat 2 sticks butter and the sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to medium; beat in the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla. (The mixture may look separated at this point.) Beat in the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with flour, until just smooth.
- Divide the batter between the prepared pans. Bake until the cakes are lightly golden on top and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to racks and let cool 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edge of the pans and turn the cakes out onto the racks to cool completely. Remove the parchment. Trim the tops of the cakes with a long serrated knife to make them level, if desired.

notes:
- "Gluten-free: Recomendation is to use Pamela's brand gluten free all-purpose flour mix and use 2 cups and 1 Tbsp. However, you can replace the all-purpose flour according to the instructions of the gluten-free flour packaging. If there are no substitution instructions, you can substitute the flour by weight (about 13.5 oz or 380 grams). Also beat the batter a bit longer to give it more structure, and bake a bit longer."
