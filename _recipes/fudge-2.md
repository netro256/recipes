tags: dessert

yield: 20 servings
preparation_time: 5 minutes
cooking_time: 25 minutes

ingredients:
- 4 Tbsp butter
- 3 cups mini marshmellows
- 1 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup cream
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp vanilla
- 12 oz chocolate chips

directions:
- Line a square glass dish with parchment paper and set aside.
- In a large saucepan, combine the butter, marshmallows, sugar, cream, and salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently until the mixture comes to a boil.
- Keep the heat on medium and stir constantly, being cautious to constantly scrape down the sides of the pan and along the bottom of the pan as you stir (this will help the sugar dissolve and not be grainy, and keep anything from burning to the bottom or sides of the pan.) 
- Boil until all the ingredients are thoroughly mixed and dissolved.
- Turn off the heat and pull the saucepan off the burner. 
- Put the vanilla and chocolate chips in the saucepan with everything else and gently combine everything until melted and smooth.
- Pour into prepared pan and spread it evenly.
- Keep the pan at room temperature until it has cooled to the touch.

notes:
- The hot boiling liquid can sometime splatter. To avoid burning yourself, wear kitchen gloves or an oven mit.

- "To Store: Store fudge in an airtight container at room temperature for 2 weeks or in the refrigerator for about a month."

- "To Make Ahead: Chocolate fudge is the ideal make ahead treat. the high amount of sugar and fat in this recipe help act as a preservative, allowing fudge to be made ahead and stored for several weeks."

- "To Freeze: Allow fudge to cool completely and harden in the refrigerator. Then cut it into cubes (or leave it as a block) and wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and tinfoil. Freeze fudge for up to 3 months."

- "Peanut Butter Fudge: Once chocolate is melted, stir in a few tablespoons of peanut butter until smooth."

- "Peppermint Fudge: Replace the vanilla with a teaspoon of peppermint extract."

- "Rocky road Fudge: with the chocolate chips, stir in 1 cup mini-marshmallows and a handful of your favorite nuts."

- "Marbled Fudge: Substitute half of the chocolate white chocolate for some of the chocolate chips and stir less."

- "Add Nuts: with the chocolate chips, stir in 1 cup walnuts, pecans, or your favorite kind of nuts."
