tags: breakfast

yield: 8 standard-size pancakes
preptime: 10 minutes
cooktime: 4 minutes per batch

ingredients:
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 Tbsp sugar
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp baking soda
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1 beaten egg
- 1 cup buttermilk or sour milk (or 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup milk)
- 2 Tbsp cooking oil
- 1 tsp cinnamon (optional)

directions:
- Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Make a well in center of flour mixture; set aside. Combine the egg, butter-milk, and oil. Add egg mixture all at once to flour mixture. Stir just until moistened (batter should be lumpy). Add additional buttermilk to thin batter, if necessary.
- For standard-size pancakes, pour or spread about ¼ cup batter into a 3-inch circle onto a hot, lightly greased griddle or heavy skillet. Cook over medium heat (or 300°F) for about 2 minutes on each side or until pancakes are golden brown, turning to second sides when pancakes have bubbly surfaces and edges are slightly dry. Serve warm.

notes: 
- "Whole Wheat-Buttermilk Pancakes: substitute whole wheat flour for all-purpose flour and brown sugar for sugar."
- "Non-buttermilk Pancakes: substitute milk for buttermilk, increase baking powder to 2 tsp, and omit baking soda."
