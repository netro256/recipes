tags: main

yield: 4 servings
preptime: 10 minutes
cooktime: 17 minutes (8 minutes each side)

ingredients:
- 2 tsp brown sugar
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp onion powder
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/8 tsp black pepper
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1 tsp olive oil

directions:
- In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, paprika, dried oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper. Stir or whisk until well combined.
- Pat the chicken dry with paper towels. Place chicken breasts in a zip-top bag or between two layers of parchment paper and use a meat mallet or rolling pin to pound them to an even thickness.
- Rub the olive oil over all sides of the chicken breasts. Then rub the spice mixture on both sides of the chicken.
- Place chicken in a single layer in the air fryer. Cook at 400° for 8 minutes, then flip the chicken over and continue cooking for 5-12 more minutes, or until the internal temperature of the chicken is 165° F at the thickest part of the breast. (The cook time will depend on the size of your chicken breasts.)
- Let chicken rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.

notes: 
- Spray the top of the chicken with cooking oil after placing it in the air fryer and after turning it to get a more "fried chicken" taste.
- Add 1/2 tsp of chili powder to the rub for a bit of heat.
- Use smoked paprika for a smoky flavor.
- You can cook these chicken breasts ahead of time to make prepping meals easier later on.
- "Refrigerator: Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days."
- "Freezer: Once cool, slice or chop (if desired) and freeze in an airtight container for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before reheating."
- "To Reheat: You can reheat cooked chicken breasts in the air fryer at 350° F for about 5 minutes. Preheat the air fryer before adding the chicken. Or, reheat gently in the microwave or oven. To keep the chicken moist when heating in the oven or microwave, add a tiny splash of water to the dish with the chicken and cover to trap in the moisture while reheating."
