directions:
- Place a sheet of plastic wrap on a cutting board or workable. Lat the chicken breasts on the plastic wrap about 2 inches apart. Lay another sheet of plastic wrap over the chicken breasts. With a meat cleaver or tenderizing hammer, flatten the chicken breasts to a thickness of about 1/2 inch. Unwrap and season the chicken breasts with the salt and pepper.
