yield: 6 servings
preptime: 15 minutes
cooktime: 25 minutes

ingredients:
- 1 1/2 tbsp avocado oil (or vegetable oil)
- 4 large garlic cloves, chopped
- 1 1.5-inch ginger, chopped
- 1/2 jalapeño chopped, adjust to taste
- 1 medium red onion, chopped
- 1 14.5-oz can diced tomatoes
- 1 tsp Coriander Powder
- 1/2 tsp Cumin Powder
- 1/2 tsp Smoked Paprika
- 1/2 tsp Turmeric
- 1 tsp salt, to taste
- 2 cups cauliflower florets
- 1 + 1/4 cup sweet potatoes diced, from 1 medium sweet potato
- 15.5 oz can chickpeas, drained
- 1 cup water
- 1 13.5-oz can coconut milk
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced
- 1 tbsp cilantro, chopped
- 1/2 lime, juiced
- 1/4 tsp garam masala
- 3 cups rice, cooked

directions:
- Heat oil in a pot on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the chopped ginger, garlic, jalapeño and onions. Cook for around 3 minutes until the onion softens.
- Then add a 14.5-oz can of diced tomatoes and stir. Cover the pot with a lid and let the tomatoes cook for 4 to 5 minutes on medium heat.
- Remove the lid and then add the spices - coriander powder, cumin powder, smoked paprika, turmeric, and salt to taste. Stir and cook the spices for 1 minute.
- Add the cauliflower florets, diced sweet potatoes and can of chickpeas. Stir until the veggies and chickpea are well coated with the spices.
- Then add water and can of coconut milk and give a good stir. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, stir couple of times in between.
- Then remove lid, add sliced bell peppers. Cover and simmer 5 more minutes.
- Remove lid, add chopped cilantro and squeeze in fresh lime juice. Turn off heat. Sprinkle garam masala. The curry might look thin at this point but it will continue to thicken as it cools down. Serve with brown rice or jasmine rice!

notes: 
- You can use curry powder in place of garam masala in the end.
- Other vegetables like pumpkin, squash, carrots, peas, spinach can also be added to this curry. If using spinach, add it towards the end, probably for the last 2 to 3 minutes only. The curry thickens considerably as it cools down. While re-heating you may need to add some water to it.
- The spices levels can be adjusted to taste. Add more of the jalapeno or cayenne pepper for extra heat.
- If you want to make this in your Instant Pot head to Manali's website for instructions because it requires some special handling.
