tags: dessert

yield: 20 dollups
preparation_time: up to 3 days
cooking_time: 

ingredients:
- 200 g applesauce
- 300 ml sugar (100 ml sugar + 200 ml sugar)
- 1 egg white
- salt (optional)
- 2 tsp geletin (or one packet - 2.5 oz)
- water
- lemon juice (optional)
- powdered sugar 
- piping bag
- non-stick paper (wax/parchment/baking paper)

directions:
- Mix applesauce and 100 ml sugar in a pot over heat until sugar dissolves. It should become thicker and drips slowly off a spoon.
- Cool the apple mixture completely.
- Transfer the apple mixture to a stand mixer (or a mixing bowl to mix by hand). Add the egg white and a pinch of salt to the mixture.
- Whip into a solid with stiff peaks.
- Add a splash of lemon juice.
- Put the gelatin into a cup and add 1/4 cup cold water. Let the gelatin expand fully.
- Prepare a water bath for the cup of geletin (warm water in a bowl with space to place the cup in the warm water).
- Warm up the cup of gelatin in the water bath. Do next steps in the meantime.
- In new Pot, add 100 ml water and 200 ml sugar.
- Boil and stir constantly (bubbling) for about 5 min. The indication this is ready is when you let it drip off a spoon onto a plate and it forms a nice bubble shape (like a bead).
- "Back to the bowl of whipped apple mixture, While slowly mixing, add the following (alternating little by little): the sugar water (from the last step) and the warm gelatin mixture."
- Once finished adding sugar water and gelatin, whip the mixture until it is stiff again.
- Put the whole mixture into one or two piping bags and squeeze into shapes on wax/parchment/baking paper
- Let sit in room temp, open air, for 1-3 days
- Coat each shape with powdered sugar and serve.

notes:
- "**Thickening agent you can choose of your own liking:**"
- "pectin - plant based. used in store bought zefir, makes the hardest zefir and fast. hardest to find in store."
- "agar agar - seaweed based. makes medium hardness zefir and fast. should be available in a variety of stores worldwide."
- "gelatin - animal based. takes extra step to add to mix. takes longer time to set and makes softer zefir. sold in most shops anywhere."
- "powder gelatin needs to expand in a 1/4 glass of cold water. after that it needs to warm up in waterbath. and then finally added into whisked eggwhites same time as sugar syrup (don't boil gelatin!)."
- "**Flavors:** You can replace applesauce with your own jam of choosing. About 200g will do fine."
