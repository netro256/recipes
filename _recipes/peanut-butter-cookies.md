tags: dessert

yield: about 7 cookies
preparation_time: 5 minutes
cooking_time: 15 minutes

ingredients:
- 1 cup peanut butter
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 egg (optional)
- 1 tsp vanilla

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350Â°F.
- Mix all ingredients together in a mixing bowl.
- Roll mixture into 1/2 inch balls, then gently press onto a baking sheet. It should be only slightly flatter.
- If you want a nice pattern on top, you can press a fork into each cookie. It takes two presses, one in one direction, and one in the perpendicular direction. If you don't want the pattern, just press the cookie a little flatter.
- Bake cookies for 15 minutes.
- Let cool for 1 minute and enjoy!

notes:
- Without the egg, the texture of the cookies don't change that much. So don't worry about including an egg if you don't have any!
