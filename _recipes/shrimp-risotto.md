ingredients:
- 2 qt chicken stock
- 1 Tbsp butter
- 1 tsp olive oil
- 2 shallots (green onions), minced
- 2 cups Arborio rice
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 cup white wine
- 2 lb shrimp
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1 cup Parmesan
- grated salt and pepper, to taste
- Lemon juice, to taste
- 2 tsp of finely chopped oregano

directions:
- Heat up the chicken stock in a small saucepan.
- In a large straight sided saute pan (or pot), add the butter and oil.
- Add the minced shallots to the large pan and sweat over low heat until translucent.
- Add the rice to the large pan and toast lightly in the fat.
- Deglaze the rice and shallots with a cup of white wine. Bring up the heat and cook off the alcohol.
- Add garlic and take two cups of hot chicken stock from the small pan and add it to the rice.
- Stir continuously and add more hot stock when the cooking liquid is absorbed. Keep stirring and adding stock until stock is all in the rice. Cook until the rice is about 80% cooked through.

- Add the cream and the parmesan cheese and stir in.
- Season with salt, pepper, lemon juice, and oregano.
- Serve on a platter.

notes:
- If you are not using Arborio rice, substitute with any rice and add a bit of cornstarch.
