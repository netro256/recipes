yield: 15 servings

cooktime:

ingredients:
- 1 tbsp red curry paste
- 3/4 cup natural peanut butter, smooth
- 1/4 cup white sugar
- 2 tsp dark soy sauce
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 tbsp cider vinegar
- 3/4 cup water (or more)
- 1 1/2 cup coconut milk (the thick cream kind) (one 14 oz can for chicken and sauce)

directions:
- Place 1 1/2 cup coconut milk and Peanut Sauce ingredients in a saucepan over medium low heat.
- Stir to combine then simmer, stirring every now and then, for 5 minutes.
- Adjust consistency with water – it should be a pourable but thickish sauce.
- Cover with lid and keep warm while cooking skewers.

notes: 
- This recipe makes more than you will need, probably only use 1/3. It's hard to make less, also this recipe uses a whole can of coconut milk and will last 1 week in the fridge – or freeze for longer.
- The original recipe calls for twice the amount of curry paste. The 1 tbsp here is still a little spicy, but not overpowering (for friends and family who need less spice).
- Chicken can be substituted with breast or tenderloin, or another meat like beef, lamb, or pork.
- Natural peanut butter is 100% peanuts and has a stronger peanut flavour than commercial peanut butter which has sugar and other additives. It is also thinner so less water is required to achieve the right consistency.
- Dark soy sauce adds seasoning and deepens color of sauce. Can substitute with light or all purpose soy sauce but sauce color will be lighter.
- Cider vinegar can be subbed with plain white vinegar. Lime juice, rice vinegar or other clear vinegars are an ok substitute but not 100% authentic.
