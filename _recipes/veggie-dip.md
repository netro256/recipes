yield: a family-size amount of dip
preparation_time:
cooking_time:

ingredients:
- 1 cup Greek Yogurt (plain)
- 1 tbsp parsley, chopped
- 1/2 tbsp mint, chopped (fresh or dried)
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp lemon zest
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp pepper

directions:
- Mix together all ingredients in a bowl. Store in an air tight container and refrigerate for up to 10 days.

notes:
- If using a container of yogurt that is about 5 oz, you can safely halve the recipe and use the full yogurt container.
- This dip has a lot of powerful flavors and some spiciness, I think it pairs best with carrots. Other veggies are great as well because they don't add too much pungent flavor, which lets the dip do the talking.
