ingredients:
- 3 large fresh tomatoes
- 3 large onions
- 3 serrano peppers
- 7 cloves of garlic
- 5 dried Guajillo peppers (stems removed)
- 3 ancho chiles (stems and seeds removed)
- 1/2 tbsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tbsp salt
- 1/2 tbsp mexican oregano
- 1/2 tbsp black pepper
- 1/2 tbsp cumin
- 1 - 4 oz can of chipotle peppers
- 32 oz beef broth
- 3 lb angus chuck (or other beef)
- 1 lb ox tail (or other beef)
- a bunch of sea salt
- a bunch of freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tbsp hog lard (or butter)
- 3 bay leaves
- 1 - 12 oz pack queso oaxaca cheese (or other cheese)
- cilantro
- 1 lime
- tortillas

directions:
- Cut tomatoes and 1 onion into quarters.
- To a large pot, add tomatoes, the onion you just cut, serrano peppers, garlic, Guajillo peppers, ancho chiles, paprika, salt, oregano, black pepper, cumin, can of chipotle peppers, and beef broth.
- Bring to low boil, covered. Cook for 30-45 minutes until the vegetables/peppers are soft.
- Let it cool.
- Pour the contents of the pot into a blender and puree.
- Cut angus chuck and ox tail into cubes (roughly 1.5 in cubes) and put into a large bowl for seasoning.
- Cover the angus chuck and ox tail with sea salt and fresh ground black pepper, and mix thoroughly so all the meat is coated and seasoned.
- On a skillet, add hog lard (2 tbsp).
- Place meat in skillet and sear all sides, not cooking all the way through.
- Dice 1 onion.
- In a slowcooker, add meat, 1 diced onion, and the puree of vegetables/peppers from the blender. Add a cup of water to blender to rinse the remaining stuff and pour it into the slowcooker.
- Set the slowcooker to high and get it up to a simmer.
- Add bay leaves, then let slowcooker cook for 4 hours on high.
- Grate the cheese and dice the last onion in the meantime.
- After the slowcooker is finished, take some of the oil off the top of the slowcooker (it is a deep maroon color) and put it in a separate dish to dip tortillas in. 
- Take some of the gravy from the slowcooker and put it in a separate bowl for dipping the tacos in. Add the juice of one lime to it, and add chopped cilantro and some diced onion to make a dipping sauce.
- Pull the meat out of the slowcooker and shred it on a plate.
- One at a time, submerge each tortilla in the oil (that you set aside earlier) and lay it on hot grittle/skillet. Add shredded beef, cheese, cilantro on top of the tortilla. Fold the tortilla over and let it start frying. Fry both sides.
- Plate tacos and serve with dipping sauce, limes, and any extra cilantro and onion you have.
