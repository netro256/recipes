Technique from The Seasoned Chef.

Preheat broiler to high. Cut the very top and bottom of the bell pepper. Cut in half vertically and remove the stem, seeds, and ribs. Place the two halves on a metal sheet pan and brush lightly with olive oil. Place under the broiler and cook until most of the skin is blackened. Remove and let cool. When cool enough to handle, peel the skin away from the flesh, being certain to scrape away any black bits of skin with a paring knife.
