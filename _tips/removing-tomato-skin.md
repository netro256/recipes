Technique from The Seasoned Chef.

Prepare an open flame by starting a blow torch. Stab a fork into your tomato. Hold the tomato over the open flame until the skin is blackened. Then rotate the tomato around until all sides of the tomato have been blackened. Then take the tomato off the fork and peel off the skin.
